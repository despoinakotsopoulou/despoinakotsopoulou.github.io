<sub> Bachelor Thesis titled "Decision Analysis for location/ allocation planning on Network".A Scientific Neural Network project to determine the optimum selection of nodes to locate/ allocate facilities on network. A hard project due to the lack of documentation both in Greek and English. Designed most of the graphs myself, delivered within deadlines.First part of the Thesis consists of the theoretical background, and second one of a technical guide with model deployment in Python and Excel. Modeled location covering problems, using Graph Theory, Stochastic, Deterministic Algorithms, and Algorithms for NP-hard problems.Considered one of the best in my department in 5 years, and equivalent to Master Thesis. A great R&D Project, further developed from the Professor I worked alongside with, to tackle Greece's unsolved problem of sanitary landfill sites. </sub>
